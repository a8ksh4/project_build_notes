# Build Highlights
In approximately newest to oldest order.  Each build tries something new.  
A few supporting software projects:
* https://github.com/a8ksh4/gpio-keyboard
* https://github.com/a8ksh4/rpi-integrated-battery-module
* https://github.com/a8ksh4/pico_keeb

# Clamshell

# Thumb Term

# Boopbarry (beepberry knockoff)


# Chonky Pocket
https://github.com/a8ksh4/chonky-pocket

An almost pocket-sized portable linux computr with 5" touchscreen, pi 4, and chording 
keyboard wired to gpio and using a bit of python and uinput module to generate keypresses. 
Possibly my favorite build so far.

# Hinged Cyberdeck
This was an experiment with an alternate form factor and an attempt to do a build around 
an Intel Compute Stick.  It incorporates an artsey.io chording keybord, AmpRipper 4k 5 volt 
power supply, and a 7" touchscreen.

# Book, aka Little Goose
This was an entry in the Cyberdeck Cafe Datatex build competition - it's a sort of 
digital book, probably a nod toward Stephenson's "The Diamond Age".  It features 
a Pi Zero 2W, 5" touchscreen, one handed chording keyboard, and all day battery life.

# Micro Note
https://github.com/a8ksh4/MicroNote

A short forey into minimalistic computing utilizing MicroPython as the OS on an RP2040
microcontroller with 1" OLED display and a hand wired chording keyboard.  This utilizked 
a modified fbconsole library to support keystroke injection, and micropython threading
to poll the keyboard in parallel to providing an interactive repl.  This was my first
implementatino of a chording keyboard firmware and was the bases for a few other projects.

# Chonky Palmtop
https://github.com/a8ksh4/chonky-palmtop

Definately the most well known build I've worked on.  Inspored by the thinkpads with 
the pop out keyboard, this build features a fold out mechanical keyboard with miryoku 
layout, a P 4, 7" touchscreen, and decent battery life.
